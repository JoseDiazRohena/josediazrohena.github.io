I'm working on an open source compressor plugin called [Valentine](https://github.com/Tote-Bag-Labs/valentine).
My goal for Valentine is to offer a cool plugin that people can learn from. I realized that I can also do this
by talking explicitly about the development process itself.

These posts originate from Valentine pull request descriptions.
